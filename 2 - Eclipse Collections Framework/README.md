# 4 - Eclipse Collections Framework Tutorial
### Hand-on lab
------------
### Notes
```
Basic collection types in Eclipse Collections are:

* ListIterable – an ordered collection that maintains insertion order and allows duplicate elements. Subinterfaces include: MutableList, FixedSizeList and ImmutableList. The most common ListIterable implementation is FastList, which is a subclass of MutableList.

* SetIterable – a collection that allows no duplicate elements. It can be sorted or unsorted. Subinterfaces include: SortedSetIterable and UnsortedSetIterable. The most common unsorted SetIterable implementation is UnifiedSet.

* MapIterable – a collection of key/value pairs. Subinterfaces include MutableMap, FixedSizeMap and ImmutableMap. Two common implementations are UnifiedMap and MutableSortedMap. While UnifiedMap does not maintain any order, MutableSortedMap maintains the natural order of elements.

* BiMap – a collection of key/value pairs that can be iterated through in either direction. BiMap extends the MapIterable interface.

* Bag – an unordered collection that allows duplicates. Subinterfaces include MutableBag and FixedSizeBag. The most common implementation is HashBag.

* StackIterable – a collection that maintains “last-in, first-out” order, iterating through elements in reverse insertion order. Subinterfaces include MutableStack and ImmutableStack.

* MultiMap – a collection of key/value pairs that allows multiple values for each key

- Having a Java Virtual Machine installed and ready to be run.
- Having a ```Terminal``` or ```Command-line```.
- No ```Java IDE``` is required.
- A ```nice text editor``` should do it job.

Finally, we successfully did the lab.

If you are not done with the lab, you can easily find and run to see the result by ```downloading/cloning this repository``` and run for yourself.
